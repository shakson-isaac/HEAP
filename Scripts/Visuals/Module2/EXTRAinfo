#Make function later:
#TODO:
##'*Make function to do enrichment with tissue types!*
##'*Survey through GTEx both overrepresentation and GSEA results*
##'*For overrepresentation split the pool into up, down, total regulated sets*
##'*Figure out a way to decompose effects in ExWAS to Tissue Specific Prediction?!*
##'*Maybe utilize CCA or PLS for the above*

#TODO:
#MAKE Visualization for a single exposure.
#MAKE visualization for multiple exposures.
#MAKE visualization to easily compare and contrast
#Do tissues first --> Then respective pathways
#'*Currently Running this on TEST Set.*
#'I should probably do both Train and TEST.
#'*Then keep associations that replicate across both!!!*

#TODO:
#Increase accuracy of pvalue estimates by setting eps = 0?
#Create Datastructure to Capture all results.
#Compare the datastructures across TRAIN and TEST sets.
#ADD Specific examples of GSEA results in supplemental figures...


#TODO:
#MAIN PRIORITY:
#Create Function to run specific enrichments (one function for each)
#Create Function to aggregate results together from multiple enrichments (Tissue, GO, KEGG, etc.)
#Create Function to visualize aggregated results across exposure types.
#Double Check: *need to split the omicID by underscores to match properly!*


#To Simplify the Story:
#Figure out if there is a way to combine enrichments across correlated exposure types to 
#get a meta-analyzed enrichment score.
#etc.
#Figure out how to aggregate across covariate specifications.
